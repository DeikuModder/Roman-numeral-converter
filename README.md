Hello! Gab here, i made my first roman numeral converter, this is something i made for one of my last projects in the freeCodeCamp javascript course, i'm kinda proud of myself with this, even tho it's not the most efficient way to do it, it's my first time, and without watching any tutorial or help on how to do it.

[What-i-learned]

I put to the test here a little bit of my string manipulation skills, as well as arrays and some of it's methods

Learned how to use modules so that i can separate the js files better, and have a better organization when i'll face bigger proects;

[Notes]

Sorry with the 4000 or more bug, i'll fix that to get a better result

[IMPORTANT]

In the js files i left bunch of comments, explaining what i did and how the logic works
